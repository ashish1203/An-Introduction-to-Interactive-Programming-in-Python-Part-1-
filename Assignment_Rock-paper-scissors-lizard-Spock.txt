/*Peer-graded Assignment: Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock*/


# Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock template


# The key idea of this program is to equate the strings
# "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", "Spock" to numbers
# as follows:
#
# 0 - rock
# 1 - Spock
# 2 - paper
# 3 - lizard
# 4 - scissors
